# covid-compliance: central role of superspreaders

A stochastic network compartmental model is adapted from public available code https://github.com/ryansmcgee/seirsplus. This model uses a modified version of the SEIRS Network model class. 

Test2.1.py shows the 4 separate infections from 4 levels of compliances of non-superspreaders and superspreaders (ss). Code can be run and manipulated depending on selected population.

Test2.2.py shows the combined 4 compliance levels of non-ss and ss.

Test2.3.py shows the division of ss in a general population. SS is often defined as the top 20% of individuals in a population.
